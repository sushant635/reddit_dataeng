1gzf0zb,How would you categorize the options to transform data for small projects (50 GB),"Hello,

I worked on several projects that have relatively small datasets (50GB total). Each project had similar (and pretty common) profiles (daily night batches, raw/staging/presentation layers in a DB, and some PowerBI or Tableau at the end).

But each of them were using totally different tools for the transformations (Python, DB procedures, ETL or ELT tools). It seems the decisions on the tooling were mostly based on the team's skills, not on the project needs. Reading more about it, I can see there are tons of ways to handle such small projects. I have a hard time to know what tool is better to use for which need.

In the case I would start tomorrow a new project from scratch, how do I choose my tooling based on the project needs and not the team skills (not saying I would ignore team skills but I am thinking about the best tech solution for customer as well).

Thank you.",10,6,0.87,antonito901,2024-11-25 09:26:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1gzf0zb/how_would_you_categorize_the_options_to_transform/,False,False,False,False

1gzq0qe,Best data replication tool (fivetran/stitch/dataddo/meltano/airbyte/etc.) 2024-2025,"So my job has slowly downsized the DE team from 8 to 2 engineers over the past 3 years. 

Data got thrown on to the wayside despite our attempts to motivate the company to be more data driven we simply had no one to advocate for us at an executive level.

The company sortve ignored data beyond the status current quo.

We’ve been keeping the lights on maintaining all open source deployments of all our tools, custom pipelines for all of our data sources, and even a dimensional model but due to the lack of manpower our DWH has suffered and is disorganized (dimensional model is not well maintained.)

The amount of projects we’re maintaining is unsustainable, tool deployments, custom etl framework, spark pipelines etc. there’s at least 80+ individual custom pipelines/projects we maintain between all data sources and tools.

The board recently realized that our competitors are in fact data driven (obviously) and are leveraging data and even AI in some cases for their products.

We go reorganized and put under a different vertical and finally got some money budgeted for our department. With experienced leadership in data and analytics.

They want us to focus on the datawarehouse and not maintenance of all of our ingestion stuff. 

The only way we can concievably do this is swapping our custom pipelines for a tool like Fivetran/etc.

I’ve communicated this and now I need to research what we should actually opt for.

Can you share your experienced with these tools?",10,9,1.0,hauntingwarn,2024-11-25 18:31:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1gzq0qe/best_data_replication_tool/,False,False,False,False
1gz3f3p,Database design help,"Hi, 

I’ve been tasked with designing an app which involves an element of database design, which is something I’ve never done before.

I’ve done some reading and watching and have learnt quite a lot about what this involves but I’m getting myself in a muddle with a few things.

I’ve done my best to make what I have so far atomic and in 1NF and (I think) 2NF/3NF, but some of the interdependences are causing my brain to hurt a bit.

It’s the stuff to the right of the yellow line that I’m not super confident on 
 

Would anyone be willing to take a look at my design and talk it through with me ? It’s for an application whereby teams will need to agree fees, rates, hours etc internally 

Many thanks in advance

We need the ability to send daily reports to a managed email list a couple times a day, have triggered alerts when thresholds are either hit or missed, be intuitive for non-technical users, connect to our snowflake and/or dbt environments for model control, and the ability for user input for if/then analysis would be a bit plus

1gztpvp,Hadoop VS Spark ,"Hi folks, happy data engineering. 
I am a data engineer in bank. We use HaDoop instead of Spark unfortunately. We still do have a lot of data and infrastructure on-prem. They have been “planning” to move data to cloud ever since I joined this company. I am trying to learn HaDoop ecosystem since I will be working on some projects using it next year. 

So my question is, learning HaDoop, YARN, MapReduce and HIVE will help me move onto Spark faster? How much of knowledge from HaDoop is applicable to Spark? 
What are the concepts that I can skip that is not relevant anymore due to the combination of cloud and Spark?
If I have experience in HaDoop, will my potential employer assume that I am the person who can work on Spark too?

1gzmmxj,Multi Region Replication: Conflicts and Ordering Issues,"I’m trying to understand how conflicts and ordering issues are handled in a multi-region replication setup. Here’s the scenario:
	•	Let’s assume we have two leaders, A and B, which are fully synced.

My questions:
	1.	If wa reaches leader A before wb, how does leader A detect that there is a conflict?
	2.	If wb reaches leader A before wa, what happens in this case? How is the ordering resolved?

Would appreciate any insights into how such scenarios are typically handled in distributed systems!

1gzt8j4,Feeling lost - UK job market,"I'm feeling lost looking for data engineering jobs in London and would love some advice about how to approach my job search.

I graduated in 2022 and I'm currently working as a data analyst at a large company (started as a junior and was promoted earlier this year). During my experience, I've become very interested in DE and have taken up any opportunities to work on DE-related tasks. But, following a data warehouse migration, my team of analysts have lost all access to creating ETL/data pipelines and have been turned into a Power BI report factory.

I feel my SQL and Python are very strong, and over the last 6 months I've dedicated myself to learning skills for data engineering: Spark, Airflow, AWS, data pipelines, etc. Now that I feel ready to start applying for jobs, I feel lost and have had no success with applications so far. My questions are:

What are the best resources/platforms for finding DE jobs? LinkedIn, Indeed, Recruiters?|

Can you provide any insight about the current state of the job market?

Can I realistically get a mid-level role, or do I have to look for junior? Realistic salary expectations?

Any other advice would be very much appreciated.
